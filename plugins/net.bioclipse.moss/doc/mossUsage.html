<h1> Usage of the MoSS plugin </h1>


<p> MoSS is a useful program when it comes to searching for frequent molecular 
substructures and discriminative fragments in a set of molecules. </p>

<p> <font size="4">First Page </font></p>
<font size="2">
<p>At the moment the program only support the notation language SMILES and a certain layout
in the input file <U> Kommer länk </U>. <br>
Directly when you open MoSS you are able to see your input in the format id,values and description.<br>
It also gives you the opportunity to unselect molecules and of course reselect them. <br>
If molecules are not completely shown the table can be resized. </p>

<p> <font size="4">Second Page </font></p>

On this page you are able to start setting your preferences. <Br>

<p><B><U>Minimum Support </U></B>gives you the opportunity to specify what minimal support a <br> 
substructure need to obtain to be reported. This is restricted to the focus part which <br>
means that they have to have a value(see input) that has to be less then its threshold.
</p>
<br><B><U> Maximal Support </U></B>if a complement part exist it can be <br>
restricted by be given a maximum support. Only substructures that fulfill <br>
this support will be reported.</p>

<p><B><U>Threshold and Invert Split </U></B> In the input file a value is to be set <U>Länk till inputfile</U> <br>
and hold the information whether or not your data should <br>
be divided into two parts, a focus and a complement part.<br>
To be able to divide your data a threshold need to be set. Molecules that contains a <br>
values less then your threshold is placed into focus part and molecules with a value <br>
greater than your threshold will be placed into the complement part.<br>
By checking the <U>Invert Split</U> box the data is inverted. 
</p>

<p><B><U>Minumum and Maximal Embedding</U></B>
By giving a minimal or maximal number of <br>
substructures one are able to restrict the size of substructures.<br>
<B>Important</B> if maximal size is set to 0 there is no restriction.<Br>
<Br>

<B><U>Type of nodes and seed types to exclude</U></B> if there are atoms one do not like to <br>
include in their mining add them in "Type of nodes to exclude" box. Same goes by seed <br>
excluding if there are atoms you do not want the mining to begin with type them in the <br>
"Seed types to exclude box"<Br> 
Good to know:<Br>
- atoms should be written in terms<Br> 
- do not add any blank steps, commas or any other token(????stämmer???).<Br>
Example 1.<Br>
If you would like to exclude carbon, hydrogen and oxygen you write CHO.<Br><Br>
By default hydrogen(H) is always excluded.<Br>

<B><U>Set seed to begin from</U></B>
TBC
 
<B><U> Closed substructures</U></B> the mining report <U>LÄNK closed substructures </U> to make an <br> alteration uncheck the box and the result will report all substructures.

<p><B>Matching of bonds and atom types</B></p>

<p><B><U>How to treat aromatic bonds</U></B>
As you might see this combo box is set to "aromatize bonds" which means that aromatic bonds are treated <br>
as an extra type.<br>
If you click on the box you will get two more alternatives "upgrade bonds" and "downgrade bonds". This means <br>
that the aromatic bonds will be treated as equivalent to double bonds respectively single bonds.</p>

<p><B><U>Ignore type of bond</U></B> and <B><U>Ignore type of atoms (chemical element)</U></B>
By default bond/atom types are never ignored if you select "always" bond/atom types will always be ignored and "in rings"<br>
means that bond/atom types will only be ignored in rings.
</p>
<p><B><U>Match charge of atoms</U></B> and <B><U>Match aromaticity of atoms</U></B>
You might also want to match or ignore other features of atoms like their charge and aromaticity.<br>
If the charge is matched then atoms with same element type but different charge are seen as different atoms.<br>
But in order to be able to ignore the atom type or the bond type in rings, ring bonds must be distinguished <br>
from other bonds therefore next checkbox with up coming comboboxes need to be set ("If to distinguish between bonds in rings ")</p>

<p><B>Rings and Chains</B></p>

<p><B><U>If to distinguish between bonds in rings</U></B>


TBC


<p><B><U>Convert from Kekulé representation to aromatic rings</U></B>
Aromatic rings can be represented in two different ways either by Kekulé representation INSERT A PICTURE <br>
where every other bond is represented as a single bond or a double bond or by actual aromatic bonds. It is <br>
recommended to convert rings to aromatic rings since it is a hindrance when it comes to matching.  

<p><B><U>Variable length in carbon chains</U></B>
Finding variable length carbon chains can be useful if one is interested in considering substructures as equivalent that only differ
in the length of carbon chains between their parts.

<p><B>Prunings</B></p>

<p><B><U>Perfect extension pruning</U></B>

<p><B><U>Canonical form pruning</U></B>

<p><B><U>Equivalent sibling pruning</U></B>

<p><B>Memory</B></p>

<p><B><U>Maximal embeddings</U></B>
Default value is 0 which indicates that there are not a limit for maximal embedding.<br>
This setting help you save memory by restriction of the maximal number of embeddings kept per graph or molecule.</p>

<p><B><U>Unembed sibling nodes</U></B>
Also a function that helps you save memory by removing embeddings of siblings of the current search tree node.<br> 
This is possible since the mining mainly consists of depth-first searches.

Notice!
Processing time could increase when using these functions!
