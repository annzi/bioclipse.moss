<h1> Usage of the MoSS plugin </h1>


<p> MoSS is a useful program when it comes to searching for frequent molecular 
substructures and discriminative fragments in a set of molecules. </p>

<p> <font size="4">First Page </font></p>
<font size="2">
<p>At the moment the program only support the notation language SMILES and a certain layout
in the input file <U> Kommer länk </U>. <br>
Directly when you open MoSS you are able to see your input in the format id,values and description.<br>
It also gives you the opportunity to unselect molecules and of course reselect them. <br>
If molecules are not completely shown the table can be resized. </p>

<p> <font size="4">Second Page </font></p>

On this page you are able to start setting your preferences. <Br>

<p><B><U>Minimum Support </U></B>gives you the opportunity to specify what minimal support
a substructure need to obtain to be reported. This is restricted to the focus part which
means that they have to have a value(see input) that has to be less then its threshold.
<br>
<br><B><U> Maximal Support </U></B>if a complement part exist it can be restricted by be given a 
maximum support. Only substructures that fulfill this support will be reported.</p>
<p><B><U>Threshold and Invert Split </U></B> In the input file a value is to be set 
<U>Länk till inputfile</U> and hold the information whether or not your data should 
be divided into two parts, a focus and a complement part.<br>
To be able to divide your data a threshold need to be set. Molecules that contains a 
values less then your threshold is placed into focus part and molecules with a value
greater than your threshold will be placed into the complement part.<br>
By checking the <U>Invert Split</U> box the data is inverted. 
</p>
<p><B><U>Minumum and Maximal Embedding</U></B>
By giving a minimal or maximal number of substructures one are able to restrict the size of
substructures.<Br>
<B>Important</B> if maximal size is set to 0 there is no restriction.<Br>
<Br>
<B><U>Type of nodes and seed types to exclude</U></B> if there are atoms one do not like to include in
their mining add them in "Type of nodes to exclude" box. Same goes by seed excluding if there are atoms you do not want the minig
to begin with type them in the "Seed types to exclude box"<Br> 
Good to know:<Br>
- atoms should be written in terms<Br> 
- do not add any blank steps, commas or any other token(????stämmer???).<Br>
Example 1.<Br>
If you would like to exclude carbon, hydrogen and oxygen you write CHO.<Br><Br>
By default hydrogen(H) is always excluded.<Br>
<Br>
<B><U> Closed substructures</U></B> the mining report <U>LÄNK closed substructures </U>
to make an alteration uncheck the box and the result will report all substructures.
