<p>An input file has to be some kind of text file for example .txt, .doc, ....
For MoSS to accept your inputs this file have to look a certain way it has <br>
it has to be divided into an identification part, a value part and a <br>
description of molecule part.
</p>

<p><B>Identification </B><br>
In this section you give all your input molecules an id <br>
it could be a character, a number or why not a name.<br>
The given identity is used in your idoutput file see  <a href="#id">Identifier output file</a>.
</p>
<p><B>Value</B><br>
When you have a search where input data needs to be split into a focus and a complement part <br>
this value is necessary. To be able to split the data into two parts a threshold <a href="readFiles.html">How to understand an input and output file</a>
is set by default 0.5. If a value is greater then the value of threshold it is placed in the complement part<br>
and if the value is less than the value of threshold it is put in the focus part.</p>

<p><B>Description</B><br>
Here is the part where input molecules are described. Since MoSS only support <br>
SMILES as a notation language your description needs to be written in this language. </p>

<p>Between the different parts you put a comma ",".</p>

<p><a name="ex1"></a> <B>Example 1 </B> - how an input file could look like:</p>

<p>id, value, description<br>
a,0,CCS(O)(O)N<br>
name,0,CCS(O)(C)N<br>
1,0,CS(O)(C)N<br>
2,0,CCS(=N)N<br>
e,0,CS(=N)N<br>
f,0,CS(=N)O</p>

<p>

<p><a name="out"></a><B><font size="4">Output file </font></B></p>

An output file will not only hold your mining result molecules but also other<br>
features such as the number of nodes and frequency in percentage. To be more specific <br>
the features displayed in the file are <I>"id","description","nodes","edges","s_abs","s_rel","c_abs","c_rel"</I>.</p>

<p><I>"<U>id</U>" -</I> To be able to separate the different results they are marked by an id number. <br>
<I>"<U>description</U>" -</I> Returns a certain substructure that fulfill the search criteria written in SMILES. <br>  
<I>"<U>nodes</U>" -</I> Gives the number of nodes(atoms) encountered in the substructure.<br>
<I>"<U>edges</U>" -</I> Gives the number of edges(bonds) encountered in the substructure.<br>
<I>"<U>s_abs</U>" -</I> Absolute support of the substructure in the focus part<br>
<dd><dd>			also known as the number of molecules in the focus part that contain this substructure.<br>
<I>"<U>s_rel</U>" -</I> Relative support of the substructure in the focus part<br>
<dd><dd>  			 the percentage of molecules in the focus part that contain this substructure.<br>
<I>"<U>c_abs</U>" -</I> Absolute support of the substructure in the complement part<br>
<dd><dd>	 		also known as the number of molecules in the complement part that contain this<br>
<dd><dd>			substructure.<br>
<I>"<U>c_rel</U>" -</I> Relative support of the substructure in the complement part<br>
<dd><dd>	 		the percentage of molecules in the complement part that contain this substructure.</p>
